This greatly\nreduces the processing power required, making playback smoother and allowing you to play over\nmore connections simultaneously.\n\nFor videos where the required codec (webm + opus) isn't available, the module will fallback to\nusing FFmpeg to encode the stream in Opus. Many new videos on YouTube are available in this codec\nso hopefully this isn't frequent.\n\nPut simply, this module finds the most efficient way to extract a stream of Opus audio from a\nYouTube video.\n\n## Usage in Discord.js 11.4.x\n\n```js\nconst ytdl = require('ytdl-core-discord');\n\nasync function play(connection, url) {\n  connection.playOpusStream(await ytdl(url));\n}\n```\n\n## Usage in Discord.js 12.x\n\n```js\nconst ytdl = require('ytdl-core-discord');\n\nasync function play(connection, url) {\n  connection.play(await ytdl(url), { type: 'opus' });\n}\n```\n\n[![Patreon](https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png)](https://www.patreon.com/discordjs)",
